      <description>Flexible foundations Pixels are easy to work with. I still think in pixels. I can imagine what a title with font-size of 66px looks like. In the end the browser computes all units to pixels. The problem with pixels is that they arenâ€™t flexible. The web is based on the idea that the user has control over the way they see a webpage. The moment you set the value of a property with pixels they become fixed and a user is unable to control it.</description>
